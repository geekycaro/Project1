          <p id="para">Welcome to my page! Here is a little intro about myself and my background. I'm a 
                licensed optician for the state of New York. I graduated from Baruch College with a 
                marketing degree and an Associate degree at CityTech in Vision Care. 
          </p><br>
          <p>I decided to join this course for the purpose of opening up opprtunities for a career
                change and individual growth. This is a very simple website to showcase my noob skills 
                and see how I progress through the course.
          </p><br>
          <p>This is a filler paragraph just so that I can have some content in this page. It looks
              better when it is more filled than looking super empty. Favorite things to do: drawing, dancing,
              singing, traveling, and much more. Jack of all trades but masters of none.
